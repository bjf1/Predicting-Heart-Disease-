# Predicting-Heart-Disease-

This inspiration behind this project was to familiarize myself more with data exploration and logistic regression. This project was a binary classification project using the Heart Disease UCI dataset (linked below) to try to predict which 'targets' in the dataset had heart disease. 

Interpretations of the data and other information can be found inside the notebook.
